Here is a cute problem from a competition paper (how do people come up
with this stuff?). A customer walks into a 7-11 store and purchases four
items. He takes them to the clerk, who uses a pocket calculator to figure
out the bill. "That will be $7.11, please." "Hold on," said the customer,
"you multiplied the four prices together. You should have added them."
"Oh, dear," responded the clerk, "you are right. I will do it again and
add." This time the clerk did it properly. "That will be $7.11 please."
